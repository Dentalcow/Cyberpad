# Cyberpad
A 6 key, 2 encoder macro-pad with a smart LED lighting bar.

Initially, I was inspired to create this macropad by the neopixels found at the bottom of its board. These pixels can be used in a large number of ways; progress bars, volume, brightness and much more. This allowed me to center the design around minimalism and a two tone semi-transparent design.
